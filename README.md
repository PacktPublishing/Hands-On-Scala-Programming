# Hands-On Scala Programming [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Scala Programming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/hands-on-scala-programming-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Over the last few years, Scala has seen a tremendous increase in its industry adoption as a tool for functional programming. Despite that, learning Scala can seem a bit intimidating, given its functional, immutable, and object-oriented nature.
This course adopts a hands-on approach to building a server-side chat application from scratch using Scala. You will begin by setting up a Scala environment with its sbt build tool. Then, you will build a server-side chat app using functional programming and recursion schemes together with immutable data structures to make your processing requests easy. Next, you'll learn about advanced Scala features such as implicits, which foster code extensibility.
Moving on through the course, you'll use Scala's rich type system to create applications that identify all possible problems at compilation time. Finally, you'll compose all knowledge and improve server-side processing to work in a concurrent and highly parallelizable way using Scala's concurrency API.
By the end of this course, you will have become fully proficient at using advanced Scala programming features in your production applications.
